#2 player Rock Paper Scissor for practice python

The rules are simple! Pick rock paper or scissors!  After a game you can type yes or no to continue or end the session!  Whoever goes second can't look or they are cheating.  That's a rule now.  That's how this works.  This is my jungle buckaroo.  Don't you step up on my turf.
